<h1 align="center">DDOS FIREWALL</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This project is designed to help you prevent DDOS attacks. The logic of the project is to return a very small page resource to requests that do not meet the appropriate conditions.</p>
<p>Attacks sent to an html source that is small in size and does not make database queries will largely not work.</p>
